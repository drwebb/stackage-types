## stackage-types

This is a repository for sharing data types across multiple packages in the
[Stackage project](https://www.stackage.org). In particular, it started as a
means of sharing code between
[stackage-curator](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-curator) and
[stackage-server](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-server).

For more information on the overall Stackage project, please see [the main
stackage repo](https://github.com/fpco/stackage).
